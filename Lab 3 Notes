- This is where we will take notes for lab. We will take notes for the day in each lab document, then transfer the important stuff to the official lab notebook, which will be used during practicals. Actual protocol is TBD. 
- Formatting: use - or numbers for lists. Create a bolded section header using #. See above. 

Today we are learning how to move around the command line. Here are some important commands. 

- pwd: print working directory. This tells you where you are in your Ron. pwd prints out: /home/users/mgg1026/gen711-811 since I am in my gen711-811 directory. 
- ls: list. This tells me everything that is in my directory, or whatever directory I am currently in. 
- clear: this clears out the command line (moves you down)
if you end a command with a ' you will get a bunch of < on new lines, no matter what you type. You can type the other ' to esacpe. If you get stuck you can type ^C to escape, or ctrl + C to escape. 
- cd: this moves you around. cd DIRECTORY/FILE moves you into that file or directory. 
- to specific options it is command -letter. ls -F tells you if things are directories or files, directories will end with /
- man: manual, will give you the manual for whatever command you do next. some of this is confusing. you can also google it. 
- q: quit something in command line
- ls -lrth: prints info about all the stuff in whatever directory you're in, also orders them with newest at the bottom
press tab to autocomplete. you should do this!
- head file: spits out 10 lines of the file. head SRR097977.fastq gives the first 10 lines of a FASTQ file (id, sequence, quality)
- cd ../: send you back one directory. cd ../../ will send you back two, etc. 

when you log in you go into home directory (mgg1026)
- cd ~: this brings you right to your home directory 
- cd $HOME: also brings you home

relative paths: tells you where to go based on where you are. 
pwd gives absolute path, since it starts at the beginnign of the computer. absolute paths can also bring you to where you want to go with cd 

grep. searches a file and returns only what contains what you're looking for
- grep '@' SRR097977.fastq  searches for @ in the file. gives you the lines that contains @. This command gave a quality score line, because @ was a quaity score. 
- grep '^@' SRR097977.fastq, ^ says to look for the next character at the start of the line. or make it more specific, and do the whole file. the chance that the quality score would = the file name is low. 

What if we want to make the grep output into a file? redirect into a file!
- grep '@SRR097977' SRR097977.fastq > headerlines.txt: this says search for this stuff in this file, then put it into a file. That makes a file in whatever directory you're in

- ls *fastq: ls things that end with whatever you put behind *

- | pipes the output of one command to the next command. ls /bin/c* | wc -l does the ls then puts that into wc -l that counts it (word count, gives lines, words, characters)

ls /bin/ | grep '^c' | wc -l does the same thing, lists the things in bin, pulls up the ones that start with c, counts them, > file would put that into a file.
